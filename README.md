406. **Queue Reconstruction by Height**  Suppose you have a random list of people standing in queue. Each Person is described by a pair of integers (h,k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people infront of person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

example:
'''
input: [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
ouput: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]

410. **Split Array Largest Sum** Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous 
subarrays. write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
constraint: 1<=m<=length(nums)<=14,000

example
'''
input= [7,2,5,10,8]
m=2

output:
18
