    "Installing the Virtual Machine\n",
    "In the next part of this course, you'll use a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a web app that uses it. The VM is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer. You can share files easily between your computer and the VM; and you'll be running a web service inside the VM which you'll be able to access from your regular browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using tools called Vagrant and VirtualBox to install and manage the VM. You'll need to install these to do some of the exercises. The instructions on this page will help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual overview\n",
    "This video offers a conceptual overview of virtual machines and Vagrant. You don't need to watch it to proceed, but you may find it informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a terminal\n",
    "You'll be doing these exercises using a Unix-style terminal on your computer. If you are using a Mac or Linux system, your regular terminal program will do just fine. On Windows, we recommend using the Git Bash terminal that comes with the Git software. If you don't already have Git installed, download Git from git-scm.com.\n",
